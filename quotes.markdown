## Below are a couple of my favorite quotes;

"If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they aren't values: they're hobbies." - Jon Stewart

“I feel safe in the midst of my enemies, for the truth is all powerful and will prevail.”  - Sojourner Truth

“I done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail; only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalised a brick; I'm so mean I make medicine sick." - Muhammed Ali
